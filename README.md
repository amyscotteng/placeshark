# Place Shark

You've heard of PlaceGoat and PlaceKitten. I proudly present to you PLACESHARK! Why? Because sharks are awesome. 
It will cycle through six images sharks:

1) Great White (carcharodon carcharias) - my favorite shark
2) Tiger shark (galeocerdo cuvier)
3) Hammerhead shark (sphyrna mokarran - the great hammerhead. There's actually three types of hammerhead sharks!)
4) Sandbar shark (carcharhinus plumbeus)
5) Nurse shark (ginglymostoma cirratum)
